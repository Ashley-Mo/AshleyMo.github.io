                    Deciding on what tool works best for your team depends, on the type of testing to be performed and the
                     kind of features you expect from the product.

                    There are a million tools available for web application testing , providing test suites which can be integrated 
                    with your code repository such as <Strong> Github
                        </Strong> or your bug tracking tools like <Strong>Jira 
                            </Strong> 
                    or your deployment systems like <strong>Jenkins</strong>, 
                    making writing and maintaining your test scripts little bit more easier.

                    Some of which i have tried is <Strong> TOSCA , Katalon and Squish </Strong> .

                    But my all time favorite is not any test suite, but it is <Strong> Selenium Webdriver
                        </Strong>  which is an excellent open source tool to start your test trials.
                    Knowledge of a programming language such as <Strong> Java , Ruby or Python
                        </Strong>  is absolutely necessary to use Selenium WebDriver. <Strong> Selenium Grid
                             </Strong> provides an excellent tool for cross browser testing too.

                             </section> &nbsp;

    If you ever wonder which code editor works best for your codes, i do have some favorites like <Strong>
        Eclipse for Java and Selenium
    </Strong> , <Strong>
         Atom for NodeJS applications
    </Strong> and <Strong> Visual Studio code for Web development HTML and CSS
         </Strong> .
</section> &nbsp;  &nbsp; 

<section>
        If you can club  <Strong> 
                Selenium with Cucumber  </Strong> , you have for yourself an excellent match for BDD( Behavior Driven Development). 
                Cucumber is one tool which can be easily used by business managers to write test scenarios in the <i> Given, When, then 
                    </i> format which any body can easily understand.

            <Section>
                    One other thing which becomes really important for web application testing would be to have a good understanding of <Strong> SOAP and REST
                        </Strong>  technologies. <Strong>
                        POSTMAN 
                    </Strong> can be a very useful tool for API testing.
