                                "You might wanna test it before you buy it !" is not just a phrase.

               I would say testing is part of who we are.  We all do testing on a regular basis , but never really knew that we were all testers.
                The primary goal of being in any business would be to sell our product satisfying the needs of the client and of course to make profit.
                I believe that everybody has an analyst, a developer and a tester in them..because we all think before taking every little decision in our life starting from buying a pen to buying yourself a new car.
As software testers we are in business because all the companies in the industry want to deliver good tested products to their clients.        </section>

                When i switched my career as a Lecturer In Electrical Engineering to Software Testing, i hardly believed in the idea of how interesting and real this field could be. 
                As time passed i realised all that takes to be a tester is the right attitude. And that would be the attitude of a customer, or as in the technical terminology the 'End User'.

                Once you are in the shoes of the customer, it is hard to miss the defects while testing. You would never wish to invest your money on a product that you don't trust, do you? If you can imagine it is your money at stake, lots of what if's would come up and that is what we convert into test scenarios and test cases eventually. 
                There are a number of tools to support testers in market today. 
                Considering that , we are in complete heaven with such cutting edge technology and tools surrounding us.

                So all that it takes to be a good tester, is from where i see it is lots of if's and what if's.  Think twice before you approve. Never stop thinking, you might be surprised by the whole lot of probabilities of things that could go wrong while testing the simplest of the application. The last thing you want to see is the product failing in front of the customer.
